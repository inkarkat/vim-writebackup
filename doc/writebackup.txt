DESCRIPTION					     *WriteBackup-description*

This is a poor man's revision control system, a primitive alternative to CVS,
RCS, Subversion, etc., which works with no additional software and almost any
file system. 
The :WriteBackup command writes subsequent backups of the current file with a
'current date + counter' file extension (format '.YYYYMMDD[a-z]'). The first
backup of a day has letter 'a' appended, the next 'b', and so on. (So that a
file can be backed up up to 26 times on any given day.) 

By default, backups are created in the same directory as the original file,
but they can also be placed in a directory relative to the original file, or
in one common backup directory for all files (similar to VIM's 'backupdir'
option), or even in a file-specific location that is determined via a
user-provided callback function. 

==============================================================================
USAGE							   *WriteBackup-usage*
>
    :WriteBackup
<
PS: In addition to this VIM script, I also provide the writebackup
functionality outside of VIM as VBScript and Korn Shell script versions at
http://ingo-karkat.de/downloads/tools/writebackup/index.html

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					    *WriteBackup-installation*

This script is packaged as a|vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in VIM; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside VIM, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the|:UseVimball|command. >
    vim writebackup.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the|:RmVimball|command. 

DEPENDENCIES					    *WriteBackup-dependencies*

- Requires VIM 7.0 or higher. 
- writebackupVersionControl.vim (vimscript #1829) complements this script, but
  is not required. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					   *WriteBackup-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your vimrc file
(see :help vimrc). 
						     *g:WriteBackup_BackupDir*
To put backups into another directory, specify a backup directory via >
    let g:WriteBackup_BackupDir = 'D:\backups'
Please note that this setting may result in name clashes when backing up files
with the same name from different directories!

A directory starting with './' or '../' (or the backslashed-variants '.\' for
MS-DOS et al.) puts the backup file relative to where the backed-up file is.
The leading '.' is replaced with the path name of the current file: >
    let g:WriteBackup_BackupDir = './backups'
<
Backup creation will fail if the backup directory does not exist, the
directory will NOT be created automatically! 

					       *WriteBackup-dynamic-backupdir*
If you want to automatically create a non-existing backup directory,
dynamically determine the backup directory based on the current filespec or
any other changing circumstances, you can set a custom callback function: >

    function MyResolveBackupDir(originalFilespec, isQueryOnly)
        ...
        return backupDirspec
    endfunction
    let g:WriteBackup_BackupDir = function('MyResolveBackupDir')
<
This function will be invoked each time a backup is about to be written. The
function must accept one String argument that represents the filespec of the
original file (the filespec can be relative or absolute, like the output of
expand('%')), and one Number that represents a boolean flag whether this is
just a query (no backup is about to be written, so don't cause any permanent
side effects).
It must return a String representing the backup dirspec (again either relative
or absolute, '.' for current directory, please no trailing path separator). 
Throw an exception if you want to abort the backup. If the exception starts
with 'WriteBackup:', the rest of the exception text will be nicely printed as
the error text to the user. 

Remember that because of the alphabetic numbering, it doesn't make much sense
if the backup directory changes for subsequent backups of the same file. Use
this functionality to adapt the backup location based on filespec, file type,
availability of a backup medium, etc., or to inject additional side effects
like creating backup directories, pruning old backups, etc. 

						     *b:WriteBackup_BackupDir*
You can override this global setting for specific buffers via a buffer-scoped
variable, which can be set by an autocmd, ftplugin, or manually: >
    let b:WriteBackup_BackupDir = 'X:\special\backup\folder'
<

							   *WriteBackup-alias*
In case you already have other custom VIM commands starting with W, you can
define a shorter command alias ':W' in your vimrc to save some keystrokes. I
like the parallelism between ':w' for a normal write and ':W' for a backup
write. >
    command -bar W :WriteBackup

- Leverage wbVC.vim to disallow backup of backup file.

HISTORY							 *WriteBackup-history*

2.00	18-Feb-2009
- Using separate autoload script to help speed up VIM startup. This is an
  incompatible change that also requires the corresponding
  writebackupVersionControl.vim version. *** PLEASE UPDATE
  writebackupVersionControl.vim (vimscript #1829), too, if you're using it ***
- ENH: Disallowing backup of backup file if writebackupVersionControl plugin
  is installed. 

1.31	16-Feb-2009
Split off documentation into separate help file. Now packaging as VimBall.

1.30	13-Feb-2009
- ENH: The backup directory can now be determined dynamically through a
  callback function.
- Renamed configuration variable from g:writebackup_BackupDir to
  g:WriteBackup_BackupDir. *** PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CONFIGURATION ***
- BF: Now also allowing relative backup dir in an upper directory (i.e.
  g:WriteBackup_BackupDir starting with '../'.
- BF: Unnamed buffers were backed up as '.YYYYMMDDa'.
- Now setting v:errmsg on errors and using ErrorMsg instead of Error highlight
  group. 

1.20	18-Sep-2007
- ENH: Added support for writing backup files into a different directory
  (either one static backup dir or relative to the original file) via
  g:writebackup_BackupDir configuration, as suggested by Vincent DiCarlo. 
- Now requiring VIM 7.0 or later, because it's using lists. 
- BF: Special ex command characters ' \%#' must be escaped for ':w' command. 

1.00	07-Mar-2007
Added documentation. First release. 

0.01	15-Nov-2002
Started development.
